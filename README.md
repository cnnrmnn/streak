# streak

**streak** is a simple command line tool that helps you track streaks. Tracking streaks can be helpful in maintaining habits. Extending a streak after maintaining a habit provides a small reward (feeling of accomplishment). It's even more useful in keeping you from breaking a habit in unusual circumstances. For example, if you're snuggled up in bed on an unsually cold morning, you might make an exception and skip your morning walk. However, if your walking streak is at 25 days and you're tracking it, you're far less likely to break the habit and ruin the streak.

There are probably hundreds of existing tools that you could use to track streaks, but I thought it'd be fun to build my own.
